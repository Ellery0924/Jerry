All development happens on GitHub. When creating a pull request, please make sure that all of the following apply:

- The tests pass. The test suite will automatically run when you create the PR. All you need to do is wait a few minutes to see the result in the PR.
- Each commit in your PR should describe a significant piece of work. Work that was done in one commit and then undone later should be squashed into a single commit.

Also, please make sure the `CHANGES.md` document contains a short note about the nature of your change. Just follow the format of the existing entries in that document. If the most recent entry is a release, please start a new section under a `##HEAD` heading.

Thank you for your contribution!
